This project was developed for the course "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Unimib).
We worked with two different datasets, applying various clustering techniques such as K-Means and DBSCAN.
After applying these methods, we analyzed the results and discussed possible interpretations.
